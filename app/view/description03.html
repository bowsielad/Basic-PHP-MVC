<p>I am developing the sliding drawer menu for my latest fitness app, I wanted to hide the menu bar icon to the sliding drawer to save real estate and only appear when the user scrolls the apps interface. This is the second sliding menu I have attempted and with less code I am happy with the results using css transitions and javascript. </p>
