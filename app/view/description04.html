<p>I have built this github repos app using a PHP MVC structure, there is no frame work involved. I was learning the way the files and folders in a MVC app are setup and I think that this such structure makes more sense the more I get to know it. I am still new to PHP and I do see that there are a few things that I still need to resolve, like showing errors if no repo is found.</p>
